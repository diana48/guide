## Add Gaps Faster with grid-gap

In this challenge you are required to use the shorthand property grid-gap to introduce a 10px gap between the rows and a 20px gap between the columns.

### Hint

The first parameter r defines the gap between the rows, the second parameter c the gap between the columns:
````css
grid-gap: r c;
````

### Solution

`````css
grid-gap: 10px 20px;
````
